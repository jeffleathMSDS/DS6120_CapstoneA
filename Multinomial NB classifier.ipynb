    "Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input.

    "Traditional neural networks cannot remember more of the past, but only the recent past (short term memory) and this is considered as a shortcoming of these networks. Recurring neural networks (RNN) can fix this problem (more on this at http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). LSTM is actually a special kind of RNN which is capable of learning long term dependencies. To solve sequencing classification and prediction modelling, we actually need the neural network to remember the past sequence so that we can classify or predict the sequence. I would recommend reading more about RNN and LSTM if you don’t know much about these topics. The section below explains how we can implement LSTM and solve the sequence classification problem.\n",

    "Word embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.

In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.\n",

This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backpropagation\n",
    "In machine learning, specifically deep learning, backpropagation (backprop, BP) is an algorithm widely used in the training of feedforward neural networks for supervised learning; generalizations exist for other artificial neural networks (ANNs), and for functions generally. Backpropagation efficiently computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input-output example. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vanishing and exploding gradients.\n",
    "In machine learning, the vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value."
